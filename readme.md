Hi there!
This is a small project about Deep Q learning, specifically using deep Q learning to solve the Lunar Lander environment in OpenAI Gym.

# Check out the report
All the details of the project are in the report.

# Run the code

The requirements.txt file defines the libraries required.

All the code is in the `code` folder.

To train the learner, run the script `code/lunar_lander.py` from the root of the project. Executing this file generates a training curve, saved as "figure.jpg" in the `models` folder, as well as a `model.pth` folder which is the state dict of the deep q learning network.

To test the learner on the environment, run `test.py` from the root of the project. This code will load the deep q learning network state dict which was saved earlier, and then run the environment with the deep q network.

The deep q network and the replay buffer are defined in `utils.py`.

# Models folder

The `models` folder contains graphs and some model state dicts.

The image generated by the `lunar_lander.py` and `test.py` is by default saved as "figure.jpg" inside the `models` folder.
